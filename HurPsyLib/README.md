## HurPsyLib
This class library project contains the model classes
which will represent experiments and their components.
The model classes defined here only contain the most basic
information about experimental stimuli, the stimulus locators
and responses, etc.
Visual applications which will help design and run experiments
will make use of these basic information to reconstruct experiments
on visual environments they target, but model classes will not
contain any details specific to any visual environments.

Here follows some basic descriptions of the model classes
in this library:
