## HurPsyLib
this is a C# class library project which contains
the model classes that represent an experiment
and experiment components.

The explanatory comments in the code files of
all those classes are collected in markdown files
generated by  the NuGet package
[**DefaultDocumentation**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DefaultDocumentation/).
They can be accessed by clicking the links
in the project's documentation file
[HurPsyLib.md](Documentation/HurPsyLib.md)

The details of this project only concern the developers
who may want to make use of them while developing their own programs
for experiments which cannot be designed and run
with the **HurPsyExp** app.
