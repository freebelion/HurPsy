## TempTrial Class

This class will serve as a boilerplate for one or more trials  
that an experiment designer wants to add to a block.  
When the designer presses the "Add Trial(s)" button on AddTrialView,  
trials with the steps formed by combinations of desired pairs  
will be added to the active block.
