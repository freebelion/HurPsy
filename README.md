# HurPsy
This group of projects is a progress of efforts
towards creating a easy-to-use cross-platform application
to design and run psychology experiments
on desktop and mobile platforms.

Its main focus is the **HurPsyLib** class library,
which was intended to help the original developer
in developing customized programs to run experiments
planned by researchers of psychology.

The next step was **HurPsyWinForms**,
a Windows Forms based desktop application
to test the experiments constructed and recorded
bu using the classes defined in **HurPsyLib**.

Both the class library and the Windows Forms application
are being developed for a programmming course targeting
graduate and PhD students of psychology in a Turkish university.
The students will follow those projects' progress report
through the file **Gunluk.pdf**,
which is the original programmer's diary. 

The **HurPsyWinForms** is intentionally kept very simple,
because it is only intended to test the experiments constructed
with **HurPsyLib** library classes. It will help the programmer(s)
to better design the class definitions.

The next step will be a WPF-based desktop project,
tentatively named **HurPsyWpf**,
which will help design and possibly run experiments
utilizing the library classes.
That step will help perfect the visual interface
which will eventually be used in a cross-platform
design application based on .NET Maui.
This final step will be the final step
which may be developed as a properietary application,
because it will require developer licenses for multiple platforms.

After sufficient progress has been made on the projects,
each one will have their own README files which should help
other developers who may want to use them as bases
for their own similar projects.
