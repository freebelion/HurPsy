# HurPsy
I am working on these projects to create
easy-to-use applications which will help
design and run psychology experiments.

Its main focus is the **HurPsyLib** class library,
which was intended to help the original developer
in developing customized programs to run experiments
planned by researchers of psychology.

I am currently working on **HurPsyDesign**,
a WPF-based desktop application
which will help design experiments
utilizing the library classes.
This step will help perfect the visual interface
which will eventually be used in a cross-platform
design application based on .NET Maui.
This final step may be developed as a properietary application,
because it will require developer licenses for multiple platforms.

As soon as I make sufficient progress on the
design application, I will start working
on an application whicl will run experiments
saved in XML files.

After sufficient progress has been made on the projects,
each one will have their own README files which should help
describe the projects to the developers from international community.
